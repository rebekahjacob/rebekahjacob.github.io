My full-time gig is in academic research. I am the Data and Methods Strategy lead for the Prevention Research in St. Louis at WashU. I work across multiple projects and lead our Data and Methods Core which aims for cohesive data strategy at the center level. This means that I wear a few hats. In a perfect world, a data analyst would be handed a beautifully clean data set and a concrete research question to explore. The reality is that while most projects I support have done a great job organizing their data, much more is needed before I can actually embark on analyses. In addition, in the perfect world the data analyst would be included in the project's planning phases, before data is even collected. This is where the right data strategy and design can really do the trick!

Outside of thinking about data all the time, I love spending time with my big family (I have 5 kids!) and doing all the outdoor things!
