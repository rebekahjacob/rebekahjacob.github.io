I think about data **A LOT**!

Much work goes into planning and executing research and community programs. Why waste all that effort with mismatched or poorly designed data infrastructure?

My expertise is in planning for robust data collection, management, analysis---which when linked to strong evaluation or research questions, give **ACTIONABLE** results.
